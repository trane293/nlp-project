## Contributions:

1. Implemented the baseline beam search based decoder for machine translation as described in [1]. The performance was above the baseline.

2. Assisted the team in understanding the beam search algorithm, and in their re-implementation which makes use of another variant using future cost.

3. Worked alongside team to tune the parameters (eta, beam_width, distortion) to get the best performing output from the implementation.
