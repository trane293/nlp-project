what happened , last Tuesday by Senate and honourable ? 
a selection committee was achievement . 
yesterday I attended on the first meeting of the committee . 
i am surprised that the committee that it does not know what to do with the Senate independent rise and too . 
i am not so that concern for the time . 
the selection committee can show some impact . 
the next two years in the work that on a senator undertaking . 
it is an important , because , in committee , to determine what these new Senate committee sit principle some senators . 
i am therefore to note that one of the last sitting of the committee to presented to the Senate was indeed nine . 
it was sent a replacement . 
it is one name , honourable senators . 
you can see that it cannot , so I am nice ? 
the Senate will have their own research to find that had been fault . 
when one a work , it must accept the do . 
the women who are sitting in the Senate have proven . 
the majority of the Senate in that duty they will remplissaient much more men . 
i remember that the veterans of the committee held to the people of meetings in February 1998 . 
the Senate sitting in the House of Commons or is it then Ni . 
they sat in the proceedings of women , the committee to all three senators . 
the leadership of the Senate did to the committee could find a man . 
i could cite the answer the question I asked him to talk , talk , senator Carstairs took . 
i asked him : " Quels were the criteria are as follows ? " 
she said that it was the first to deal with the representation of women in a report . 
it was on the parliamentary associations wrote that in 1993 . 
at the time of men were only delegations formées Les . 
this is in this regard , I have been replaced by Senator Finestone for a number of years . 
however , I want the opportunity to look back preferred my association . 
i do not know when the decision about these two will be no Senate and House how honourable reports . 
when is the senators on television every verdict . 
by a group of students , or any of or wondered journalists . 
that if we do ? 
it is true , I believe it . 
however , it should be translated in fact . 
i do not believe in the alternative . 
if this position in committee , he or she should a part of a senator accept any meetings intended . 
we are not the corridors of which we say in hon. members : 
today there is a question , and in committee to study after two years , " Présentez final " you in committee . 
they do not know what they are viewed out to them when they stand , but also stand their leaders . 
they do not know at what happened . 
the words " '' , " and " is the way in our dedication continuité speech honourable senators . 
in the coming weeks and for how we are beginning to address the Senate two independent think . 
if we do not do this , who are concerned about the parliamentary committee on my own I créerai world affairs . 
no one can we will try . 
the Speaker : the Honour 
if not speak , is it the pleasure to adopt the motion , you like any other hon. Senator senators , honourable ? 
some hon. members : 
in agreement . 
( motions deemed adopted , the report agreed to )
